0. Wrote a function that produces output according to a format.
* Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...);

1. Write a function that Handle the following conversion specifiers:

* d
* i
* You don’t have to handle the flag characters
* You don’t have to handle field width
* You don’t have to handle precision
* You don’t have to handle the length modifiers

2. write a function that Handle the following custom conversion specifiers:

* b: the unsigned int argument is converted to binary

3. write a function that Handle the following conversion specifiers:
* u
* o
* x
* X
* You don’t have to handle the flag characters
* You don’t have to handle field width
* You don’t have to handle precision
* You don’t have to handle the length modifiers

4. Used a local buffer of 1024 chars in order to call write as little as
possible.

5. write a function that Handle the following custom conversion specifier:

* S : prints the string.
* Non printable characters(0 < ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are p
rinted this way: \x, followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal
(upper case - always 2 characters)

6. wrote a function that Handle the following conversion specifier: p.

* You don’t have to handle the flag characters
* You don’t have to handle field width
* You don’t have to handle precision
* You don’t have to handle the length modifiers

7. wrote a function that Handle the following flag characters for non-custom
conversion specifiers:

* +
* space
* #
8. wrote a function that Handle the following length modifiers for non-custom
conversion specifiers:

* l
* h
* Conversion specifiers to handle: d, i, u, o, x, X

9. wrote a function that Handle the field width for non-custo\
conversion specifiers.

10. wrote a function that Handle the precision for non-custom conversion
specifiers.

11. wrote a function that Handle the 0 flag character for non-custom
conversion specifiers.

12. wrote a function that Handle the '-' flag character for non-custom
conversion specifiers.

13. wrote a function that Handle the following custom conversion specifier:

* r : prints the reversed string

14. wrote a function that Handle the following custom conversion specifier:

* R: prints the rot13'ed string

15. wrote a function where all the above options work well together.
